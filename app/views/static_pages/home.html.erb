  <h2>
 	Welcome. This is the first version of this website. For the moment there is no user management system, our CSS is just the one generated by Bootstrap and we don't have any database. But the first few pages are created. This includes The About Us page to present ourself, the (future useful) help page to have information on how to use the service, the blog page, which gives a direct link to our blog, and finally the (future) API page.
